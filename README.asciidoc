=== Export configuration

* `Format`: Dataset format.
* `Include tables`: Name of tables to include in generated dataset. If empty all tables will be exported.
* `Dependent tables`: If true will bring dependent included tables. Works in conjunction with `includeTables`.
* `Query list`: A list of SQL statements which resulting rows will be used in generated dataset.
* `Output dir`: directory to generate dataset.
* `Name`: name of resulting dataset. Format can be ommited in dataset name.

=== Oracle database
As oracle jdbc driver is not on maven central the plugin doesn't come with it on classpath hence it cannot connect to Oracle DB by default.

In order to make the plugin work with oracle will you need to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html[download the jdbc driver] and copy to `dbunit-addon folder` located at *user_home/.forge/addons/com-github-database-rider-addon-dbunit-addon-1-0-0-SNAPSHOT*
